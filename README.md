# Motivation

My journey into coding started while I was working as a personal trainer. I needed an app to help track client progress, manage bookings, and capture workout videos — but nothing available suited my needs. With encouragement from a client, I decided to build my own solution.

That led me to programming, starting with Python, then diving into JavaScript. I later trained at Makers, where I explored Ruby and deepened my passion for development. Coding quickly became more than a skill, it was something I thought about constantly and knew I wanted to pursue professionally.

# Background

I’m a full-stack developer based in London, with hands-on experience building scalable, high-performing web apps using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.

I previously worked at Upstream, a streetwear rental platform, where I collaborated closely with the co-founder to shape the product, led feature development, delivered stakeholder presentations, and helped transition the app from mobile to web.

Before that, I was a developer at Clu, a tech-driven recruitment platform, where I implemented Google Analytics & GTM, enhanced platform functionality, and improved team workflows. I also worked at ReLyfe, a medical startup, focusing on mobile-first development, code refactoring, and Cypress testing.

My background in personal training and Computer Science gives me a unique perspective. I understand people, goals, and how to build systems that genuinely help. I continue to be mentored by [Patrick Orrell](https://github.com/paddyo), the client who first nudged me toward software development.
