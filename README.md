# Motivation

I began my coding journey while trying to find an app that would help my clients and I, the specification I wanted were not on any app. My client who is a senior developer suggested I build my own, I stared understanding what programming is with Python then quickly realised my passion for Front-end in particular JavaScript. Whilst self-learning I found myself dreaming of the code and that it was on my mind all the time. It had become clear to me I was enjoying myself coding and wanted to make it a career.  

# Background

I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), looking for my first role as a Junior FrontEnd Developer. 

I originally studied Computer Science at Kingston University before becoming a Personal Trainer, whilst being with individuals on a daily basis I believe I have strong people skills as each client I trained was different and this helped me adapt to each one.  Similar to programming each client is like a project and has specifications of what they want to achieve within a given time. My client turned mentor [Patrick Orrell](https://github.com/paddyo) has helped guide me during my transition.
